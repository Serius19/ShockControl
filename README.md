# ShockControl
Python Program to accept Rigol DS1054Z csv files, with future plans to combine with straight connection to oscillicope to collect data on triggering.

Current features
  - Output data to accleration and time from inputted accelerometer sensitivities to text file
  - Calculate and plot acceleration SRS

Future work
  - Output SRS data to text file
  - selection for half-sine shock testing or SRS
  - plotting of limits
  - Output to Austest Excel spreadsheets
  - Connect to oscilliscope and download data on triggering + editting oscilliscope setting from gui
